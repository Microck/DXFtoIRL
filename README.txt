Here's a brief README file for your GitHub repository. It assumes the script is part of a small project for converting DXF files to PDF. Feel free to adjust the content as needed.

# DXF to A4 PDF Converter

A Python script to convert DXF files to multi-page A4 Landscape PDF documents while maintaining 1:1 scale for accurate real-life dimensions.

## Overview

This tool reads a DXF file (commonly used for CAD drawings) and generates a PDF output tiled across multiple A4 Landscape pages if necessary. It's designed to preserve the original dimensions of the drawing, ensuring that measurements in the PDF match real-world sizes when printed at 100% scale.

## Features

- Converts DXF files to PDF with 1:1 scaling
- Supports tiling across multiple A4 Landscape pages for large drawings
- Handles common 2D entities like LINE, CIRCLE, ARC, LWPOLYLINE, POLYLINE, SPLINE, and ELLIPSE
- Includes debug output for troubleshooting

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `ezdxf`, `reportlab`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install ezdxf reportlab
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line with the input DXF file and desired output PDF file paths:

```bash
python a4.py "path/to/input.dxf" "path/to/output.pdf"
```

Ensure you replace `path/to/input.dxf` and `path/to/output.pdf` with the actual file paths.

**Important:** When printing the PDF, select "Actual Size" or "100% Scale" in your printer settings and disable any "Fit to Page" options to maintain accurate dimensions.

## Limitations

- Currently supports a limited set of DXF entity types (focus on 2D geometry)
- May not render complex entities or block references fully
- Assumes DXF units are in millimeters (mm)
